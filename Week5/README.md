# Person Management System (OOP Inheritance Demo)

# Project Overview
This project demonstrates the use of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) inheritance** in Python based on a given system structure.

The system models people in an educational institution using a clear class hierarchy:
- A base `Person` class
- Two derived classes: `Student` and `Staff`
- Further specialization of `Staff` into `General` and `Academic`

The design follows inheritance principles to promote code reuse, clarity, and scalability.
